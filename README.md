# Kingdoms
Beginner Standalone idle Game
Welcome to the test site for my summer project of Kingdoms. Kingdoms is to be an Idle clicker Game with many aspects to it. An active part in the form of battling armies of other Kingdoms and through exploring lands/caves/dungeons. A more passive aspect would be the managing of your own Kingdom by procuring resources for maintaining it, expanding, upgrading building etc. It will be written in Java to start out with as I know Jack Shit about code for the moment being but Codecademy and Reddit are my friends.
